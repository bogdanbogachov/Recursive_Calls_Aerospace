# Recursive_Calls_Aerospace
This tool was created at my work place in order to facilitate a procedure of part numbers search.

Please note, since this project was done for an aerospace company and most of their information is confidential, I changed names of tables and values in those tables
in the database to which I was connecting.

The tool can be run only on my work computer, since it is impossible to access the subject database from outside the company.
However, this fact should not be a roadblock to check the code and architecture of the tool.
